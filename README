Twitter_DWH
===========

About
=====
This ETL application is used for my professional (as opposed to personal)
weblog at http://blogs.infosupport.com/author/kooss/.

Requirements
============
- Python 2.6+
- MySQL

Installation
============
The following steps will lead to a successful installation:
- Create a user with sufficient rights (root will do, but is not that safe 
  ;-)) within MySQL
- Execute contents of the file 'SQL/twitterdb_MySQL.sql' as a SQL script within
  MySql
- Run 'main.py' inside the directory 'python'

This will create a new file with the name 'settings.cfg' inside the working
directory. Inside 'settings.cfg', the sections 'Twitter API' and 'Database'
must be updated with the right settings. 

Warnings:
 !! Do not alter the Twitter Authentication settings manually !!
 !! If you don't understand what 'consumer_secret' and 'consumer_key' are
    for, please read the section below !!

- Run 'main.py'

This time, the output will be: 
"please go to this url : http://(long URL at twitter.com)"
"Enter the PIN you are given at the above url : "
When you go to the mentioned URL, you will be able to authorize your (just
registered) application to read the data of your Twitter account. When you 
click 'Authorize app', you'll be given a PIN which should be
entered at the prompt.

At this point, the authorization should work. However, in my own experience
sometimes a 401 (not authorized) access would occur after creating a new
application. In that case:
1. Reset the keys at the Twitter Dev website for your application
2. Update the consumer key & secret inside settings.cfg
3. Remove the values of auth_key and auth_secret inside settings.cfg
4. Re-start main.py

After these steps, the application should work fine, pull information from
Twitter and store it in the local MySQL database!

About consumer_secret and consumer_key
========================================
Because this application is for development purposes, it needs to be able to
authorize itself when communicating with Twitter. To provide the means of 
authorization, Twitter requires you to:

- log in at Twitter.com
- head to dev.twitter.com
- register you application (click 'Create an App')

After registering your application, you will have your application under the
'My applications' menu option (dev.twitter.com -> top-right is your profile 
image providing a drop-down menu -> click 'My Applications'). 

Your application page should read your consumer key and consumer secret.
